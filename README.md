# Hi, I'm Umaima :octocat: ðŸ‘‹

As a Software engineer, Data Science & Machine Learning (ML) Engineer, I have enjoyed the challenges of solving real-world data-driven business problems from problem formalization to technical solution design, development, and deployment, partnering with several key lines of business and functions globally. I have gained extensive technical and project/product management skills and developed valuable team/stakeholder management capabilities by working cross-functionally with analytics, engineering, and business engagement teams. 

### âœ¨ I am a firm believer that learning has no end; I learn something new every day! My goal is to expand my knowledge while also helping others from my knowledge pool, especially in data and technology. âœ¨
